# Distillery Edge Module

This module is a component in the overall suite of containers running on the Edge Device.
This module will receive telemetry from the downstream controllers, and then decide what happens
with it next--particularly what gets sent to the cloud and when.

The overall Edge Device composition is defined in the `deploy/edge` folder.
